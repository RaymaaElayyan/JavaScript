Structuring --> not using item.name
trunkate?
high quality code, well structured with time and space.
//AMD(zman) or common GS(divide the code into files)
modules->export and import but 2013 was only commmon GS
now modules:
relative and absolutepath.
2009-2013 no modules.
as defult common js.--> need to be edited file by file but to use it i want to give it a sign im gonna use common js/import, export
 so to alret it insteadof .js --> mjs

named by name
export by its method->
export default 
module.export or require is only for commmon js when its .mjs its export or import

the exporting and importing like python , pythin has no export,,
export->named(by its name ) and default(by the obj)
module os , fs , 3rd patner modules(from internet)
core module from ancient cant use export and import


3rd part module(NPM):
Lets downloadONE
npm init -y  ---> we downloaded it
we downloaded chalk--> it appears only via the terminal its made for it not for the normal output its only a txt
BOOTsrcrap??
__________
Asynchrononus->single thread:
blocking?first one then the next
ccook a chicken for 25 dont over look at it its an individual thread just let it done its work and it will be teeling u in a tone ring , u go do the salad
Sequentially is so bad..
blocking and asyncrononus(non blocking)-->single thread does it self multi thread
webi-I?
CallBAckFunction:

setTimeOut()

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
//const --> resolve error:

promise.then((rr)=>{
  console.log(rr)
})

.then is same as .await()
---then go to the vs code
from micro to call stack:
